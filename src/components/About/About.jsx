              <p>
               My primary focus is on crafting intuitive and visually engaging user interfaces that provide seamless user experiences. With a strong eye for design and attention to detail, I excel in using tools like Figma to transform ideas into polished prototypes and functional designs
              </p>
              <br></br>
              <p>
              In addition to my frontend expertise, I have hands-on experience with backend development, including building RESTful APIs using Spring Boot and managing databases with MySQL. During my time as an intern and through academic projects, Iâ€™ve worked collaboratively in Agile environments, contributing to end-to-end development and refining my skills in both design and coding.

              <br></br>
              <p>
              I am currently seeking co-op or internship opportunities where I can leverage my skills while continuing to grow as a developer.
